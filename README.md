# AraNLP

AraNLP library is a Java-based toolkit for the processing of Arabic text. It supports the most important preprocessing steps, such as diacritic and punctuation removal, tokenization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, root stemming, light stemming, and word segmentation. These tools are usually required to prepare the text for more advanced NLP tasks.

The goal of AraNLP is to gather most of the vital Arabic text preprocessing tools into one library that can be accessed easily. Therefore, We incorporated missing tools and included existing algorithmic resources.

AraNLP has already been used in many experiments to prepare the Arabic text and it successfully preprocessed the corpus.
